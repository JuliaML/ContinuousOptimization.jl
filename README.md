# ContinuousOptimization (WIP)

This is a playground for implementations of "Unconstrained Continuous Full-Batch Optimization" algorithms. (the name is due to a discussion on [Optim's gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl))

The goal is to develop this using the new MetaLearner framework currently in [StochasticOptimization](https://github.com/JuliaML/StochasticOptimization.jl) and implement the algorithms in a flexible, modular way.

This is experimental, and should only be used by collaborators.  This may not be good, or even correct.  However, if you have any expertise in this area, please chip in!
