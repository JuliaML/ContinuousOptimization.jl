# ContinuousOptimization (WIP)

This is a playground for implementations of "Unconstrained Continuous Full-Batch Optimization" algorithms. (the name is due to a discussion on [Optim's gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl))

The goal is to develop this using the [LearningStrategies](https://github.com/JuliaML/LearningStrategies.jl) framework to implement Optim-style algorithms in a flexible, modular way.

This is experimental and a work in progress, and should only be used by collaborators.  This may not be good, or even correct.  However, if you have any expertise in this area, **please chip in** by implementing new algorithms!
